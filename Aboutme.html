		<section> Hi, I'm Tala  </section>
		<section> I am fifteen years old. I go to New Roads. I have a dog named Mint, and a cat name Klee. I know how to speak a little Japanese, which is also my favorite kind of food. I used to go to Ocean Charter, and I was there from Kindergarten to eighth grade. </section>
		<section> I really  enjoyed all my classes.  So far my New Roads experice is going pretty well.</section> Here's a nice poem:
		The world is a beautiful place
		to be born into
		if you don't mind happiness
		not always being
		so very much fun
		if you don't mind a touch of hell
		now and then
		just when everything is fine
		because even in heaven
		they don't sing
		all the time
