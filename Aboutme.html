		<section> Hi, I'm Tala Kurup </section>
		<section> I am fourteen years old. I am a ninth grader at New Roads School. I have a dog named Mint, and a cat name Klee. I know how to speak a little Japanese, which is my favorite kind of food. I used to go to Ocean Charter, and I was there from Kindergarten to eighth grade. </section>
		<section> I enjoy singing, dancing, and art. </section>
		<section> Over the couple weeks I've been here, I really have enjoyed all my classes. My top three would probable be Honors Biology, English and World Civ. So far my New Roads experice is going pretty well.</section>
